# Compiler_for_GO-langauge
Using Java and JAVACC I designed a mini Interpreter that  handle errors and execute statements for GO codes
( With alot of help of OOP logic )
The main startments that i checked on are :
My Mini GO language will include the following statements
1- Input statement
2- Output statement (can print variable value or concatenation
3- string with variable value …….).
4- Assignment statement
5- If statement (with single condition or multiple conditions (“ && or || ”).
6- For statement
7- Switch statement
8- While statement
   Example:
   x :=0
   for x <= 10 {
   x ++
   }
9- Repeat until loop
   Example:
   x :=0
   for {
   fmt.println(x)
   x++
   if x==5 { break }
  }
